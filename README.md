# dotworkspace

A workspace server that allows LLMs to create and run their own tools on your local machine.

## Usage

`dotworkspace` requires Bun 1.2.0 or higher to be installed. View the [Bun homepage](https://bun.sh/) for one-line installation instructions.

To start the server and store your workspace at `~/.workspace`, run the following command:

```bash
bun dev -w ~/.workspace
> Your workspace at ~/.workspace is listening on localhost:3000
```
